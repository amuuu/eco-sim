# Ecosystem Simulation
Howdy. This was supposed to be a collection of tools for making games but it has become a quest to develop an ecosystem simulation.

The tools are being developed in a modular and reusable manner. The pieces that creates the sim exist within a separate project within the solution. 

Here are the current reusable features:
- Entity Management (Game loop, ECS)
- Resource Management
- Event System
- Decision System
- Collection of general components
- General Tools 
    - Templated/Macro-wrapped design patterns
        - Object Pool
        - Singleton
    - Timer
    - Logger
