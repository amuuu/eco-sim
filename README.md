# Game Systems

Greetings wanderer. This is a collection of tools and systems that can be used in game dev, all written in C++ [**That is actively being developed and is not ready by any means yet.**]

Here are the current features:
- Entity Management (Game loop, entities)
- Resource Management
- Event System
- Decision System
- General Tools 
    - Templated/Macro-wrapped design patterns
        - Object Pool
        - Singleton

There are a bunch of projects in this Visual Studio solution:
- `GameSystems`: The main project, a static library
- `TestSuite`: A GoogleTest test connection
- `DemoWithConsole`: A console demo
- `DemoWithImGui`: A demo with ImGui.
